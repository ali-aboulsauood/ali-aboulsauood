# About me

> Hello, World!

<i>A medical student who has a deep interest in computer science and programming</i>.

My interest in programming started in early childhood, with an old computer schoolbook I borrowed from my cousin. It used [Visual Basic 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)) as a model to teach object-based programming. I was then fascinated by the idea that you can make the computer do whatever you want by communicating with it through a certain language the same way you can make someone do something for you by asking them. This, and the idea that I could turn any idea into reality by programming, felt like magic to me back then.

Fast forward to middle school, my long-forgotten interest was ignited again, when I attended computer lessons. Though the computer curriculum was (hopefully not still) of subpar quality, and I was essentially the only person who was even remotely interested, my passion for programming made me try and get the most out of it. I learned the basics of HTML, variables, functions, `for` and `while` loops, and other stuff that did not stick with me because it was complicated and the curriculum did not do a good job teaching it to us...

During high school, I tried to enter the world of programming by learning HTML (<i>lol</i>), but then I gave up, before coming back during college, but this time I decided to learn programming the right way, starting with the basics, which I am currently learning using C++.

So far, I have learned the very basics as well as the basics of object-oriented programming (<abbr>OOP</abbr>), which I find an interesting programming paradigm. Soon - Allah willing - I will start learning data structures and C#.

I still have not decided which track I will take in the future, but most likely I will go for web development.
